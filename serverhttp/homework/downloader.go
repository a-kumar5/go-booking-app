/*
The first program downloads comic metadata
   1. We will read until we get two 404 responses in a row
   2. Each request will generate a JSON object as a string
   3. We will bracket them with [ and ] and a comma between
   4. The result will be a file with a JSON array of metadata objects, so we won't need to decode
   5. We will optionally take a filename from the command line for output
